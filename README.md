# Simon_Says
I create Simon Says game using HTML for the structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for the functionality. It includes buttons that correspond to different colors, a "Start Game" button, and logic for generating a sequence, showing the sequence, allowing the player to repeat it, and verifying the input.
